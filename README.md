# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Data Bootcamp Module 17: Supervised Machine Learning and Credit Risk
## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this project is to use supervised machine learning (ML) to build a models to predict credit risk. For this matter, we used RandomOverSampler, SMOTE, ClusterCentroids, LogisticRegression, SMOTEENN, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier.



## Process and results

For each model, the following results were obtained:

**Summary**

All of the resampling models (Random Oversampling, Smote Oversampling, ClusterCentroids and SMOTEENN) show low accuracy levels with values that are close to 60% or less in some cases. On the other hand, the ensemble models show a larger accuracy (more than 90%).
